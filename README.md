# GasConduits

This mod uses EnderIO's Fluid Conduits as a base but has been modified to support Mekanism Gas instead of fluids. I decided that I wanted to make a mod that adds support for Mekanism Gas mainly so that I can have conduit bundles/intersecting conduits without having to have `U`s to get around pipes for compact machine setups.

I believe I have fixed all the bugs but if you run into any please report them here, not to EnderIO or Mekanism. Part of the reason EnderIO decided against implementing support for Mekanism Gas is because of how many issues they had reported back in 1.7.10 that were due to oddities in Mekanism.
